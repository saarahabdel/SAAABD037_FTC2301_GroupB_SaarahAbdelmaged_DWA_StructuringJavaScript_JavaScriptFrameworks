What is Code Style?
> identation
- JavaScript compilers dont care for line breaks and indentation 
- minified code are single lines of JavaScript (no indentation/line breaks)
- indentation helps the viewer see the relationship between things at a glance 

> To use space or tabs? Subjective
- space leaves dot characters
- spaces are hard coded
- tabs leaves arrow characters
- tabs are dynamic (your code editor controls how big the character is)

> Line Length
- different programming languages have a tendency for longer or shorter lines

> White Space 
- eg. console.log( 'Hello' ) OR console.log('Hello')
- for eg. according to Airbnb styleguide, have spaces around the brackets when destructing
const [ one, two, three ] = array

> Naming Conventions 
- more often than not is speaks to which casing you use 
- most popular: snake_case, kebab-case, camelCase(JS Variables & Functions), PascalCase(JS Classes), SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE(JS Constants)

> Comments
- try not to overly comment
