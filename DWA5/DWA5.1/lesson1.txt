> There is a difference between Bugs and Errors 

- bugs arent necessarily good or bad 
- bugs are unintended effects, things we dont foresee 
- eg. a bug that created the creeper in MineCraft


- eg. its much better for someones banking app to crash and exit rather than allowing it to function in 
an unsafe state which might allow them to transfer money incorrectly
- thats why we appreciate errors to prevent unsafe states 

> Therac 25
- cancer treatment machine, meant to replace the previous model (Therac 24)
- machine started throwing errors but never explained what they were, also allowed
them to be dismissed and continue using the machine 
- race condition in the software resulted in an unsafe state which resulted in high 
doses of radiation 
- example on procing why its dangerous to avoid errors.
