ABSTRACTION AS A CONCEPT 

- where low and high level ideas meet

> Low Level Elements 
- variables 
- functions
- loops
- if statements
- etc

> High Level Elements
- managing complexity 
- errors and debugging
- comments
- code style

> Abstraction 
- exmaple: do fish know they're wet (a book)
- example: 1+1=2 (never questioned it but it is a thing)
- example: E=mc^2 , Pi, sin, cos, tan
- all of those above allow us to express complex things in a simple manner
- abstraction hides the details and give us the ability to talk about problems
at a higher (or more abstract) level

> Chunking
- our brain only has the ability to look at a range of things to a certain degree
- our brain has the ability to split things into chunks in order to make sense of them
- example: spaces in phone numbers
